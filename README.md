## Game : Shoot2Live

    This is a shooting game where you can't see back, you need to shoot the enemies by predicting their positions in dark......Make 60 to win the game

## Controls :

    1) Use the right and left arrow keys to move around
    2) Use the space bar to shoot the enemies

## Framworks used :

    I used a light-weight framework called the kontra.js
    It's easy to use and provides a lot of flexibilty
